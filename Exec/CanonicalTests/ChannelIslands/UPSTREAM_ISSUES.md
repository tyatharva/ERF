# Upstream-reportable findings (erf-model/ERF and erftools)

Compiled during the ChannelIslands single-precision hindcast bring-up
(this fork, branch `ERF`; each item verified against upstream
`erf-model/ERF@development` where noted).

## 1. HindCast pathway: state is never initialized from data; theta/moisture never forced (docs contradict code)

**Documentation says** (`Docs/sphinx_doc/theory/HindCast.rst`, step 4):

> "Copy the initial condition file to the ERF run directory. This can be the
> first file in the ``hindcast_boundary_data_dir``."

and its inputs example lists:

> ```
> // Initial condition filename -
> // obtained from running the python script
> erf.hindcast_IC_filename = "ERF_IC_2025_08_18_00_00_000.bin"
> ```

**Code does**: no source file parses `hindcast_IC_filename` (grep of
`Source/` — zero hits; confirmed identical in upstream `development`'s
`ERF_WeatherDataInterpolation.cpp`). The interpolation machinery reads rho,
u, v, w, theta, qv, qc from the `.bin` frames but writes **only `Rho_comp`**
(plus lat/lon) into the forecast arrays; theta and moisture are interpolated
into temporaries and discarded. Nothing fills `vars_new` from data at
initialization, and the lateral sponge (`ERF_ApplyBndryForcing_Forecast.cpp`)
relaxes **momenta only**.

**Evidence** (this fork, `max_step=0` plotfile of the full hindcast config):
`x_velocity = y_velocity = 0` identically, `qv = 0` identically,
`theta = 300.000 +/- 0.01 K` (the dry-isentropic HSE base state), i.e. the
"hindcast" initial state contains no ERA5 information whatsoever, and during
the run only momentum is anchored to ERA5. Verified live boundary forcing:
after 30 s of model time the sponge bands carry |u| up to 35.7 m/s (matching
the ERA5 data) while the interior spins up from rest — so the momenta path
works; theta/qv have no large-scale anchor at all.

**Suggested fix**: either implement the documented IC read + extend the
sponge to `RhoTheta`/`RhoQ1` (the fill kernel already interpolates them), or
correct the documentation. WRF-style practice (wrfbdy carries theta and
moisture) argues for the former.

## 2. GPU cross-stream race in the hindcast step path

With default AMReX stream counts, the full hindcast configuration produces
NaN in memory-dependent, run-to-run-varying regions within one step. With
`amrex.max_gpu_streams=1` the identical binary/config is clean and
bit-reproducible (1-step and 30-step verified). `compute-sanitizer
--tool initcheck` reports zero errors on the failing configuration (after
the fixes in item 3), isolating a true execution-order race rather than
uninitialized memory. Racing kernel pair not yet identified.

Additional bracketing (2-km config, all item-3/4 fixes in): the race still
exists but is RARE at 6 boxes — one NaN event in ~390 cold-start steps at
4 streams (corruption in a plain dycore step, 8 steps after the last
radiation call, with the surface path disabled — so it is in the ordinary
hindcast step path, not radiation-interop or surface code), while two
200-step multi-stream runs were clean and mass-identical to one-stream.
At 1 km (24 boxes) it fires within one step. Frequency scaling with box
count fits a cross-stream timing-window race. Reproduction: this fork @
`ERF` branch, `Exec/CanonicalTests/ChannelIslands/`, remove
`amrex.max_gpu_streams=1`; use the 1-km config (git history, commit
0bd051d5) for an immediate repro.

## 3. Uninitialized-memory defects found via compute-sanitizer initcheck

All fixed in this fork (commits noted in git log); upstream should verify
which apply to `development`:

- `ERF_SurfaceDataInterpolation.cpp`: `ProbLo()`/`CellSize()` host pointers
  captured in a device lambda (CUDA error 700 on first surface-data read).
- `FillSurfaceStateMultiFabs`: writes only the k==0 plane of a 2D slab that
  inherits the 3D state's ghost vector (z-ghost planes left unwritten and
  then copied/blended).
- `SurfaceDataInterpolation`: the `surface_state_interp` time-blend LinComb
  is commented out upstream while the slow-RHS consumes the MultiFab
  whenever `hindcast_surface_bcs` is on (garbage land-sea mask).
- `WeatherDataInterpolation`: forecast velocity fill kernels cover valid
  face boxes only; the interp LinComb blended their uninitialized ghosts.
- `ERF_ProbCommon.H read_custom_terrain` (plain format): query points at or
  epsilon past the last terrain grid line read past the coordinate arrays
  (OOB). Terrain files that end exactly at the domain edge trigger it.
- `ERF_TerrainMetrics.cpp` STF branch: `h_mf`/`h_mf_old` FillBoundary'd
  before all planes are written.

## 4. Hindcast bulk-coefficient surface treatment misreads state components

`ERF_ApplySurfaceTreatment_BulkCoeff.cpp` (CC variant) computes
`uvel = cons_state(i,j,k,1)/cons_state(i,j,k,0)` — component 1 is
`RhoTheta`, not momentum, so "velmag" evaluates to ~theta ≈ 300 (m/s scale)
over sea. Latent/sensible bulk fluxes are then ~an order of magnitude too
strong. Only active with `erf.hindcast_surface_bcs = true`; all-ocean
hurricane cases may have tolerated it. **Fixed in this fork**: the CC variant
now takes the face-velocity arrays (`u_arr`/`v_arr`, averaged to cell
centers) plumbed through `make_sources`; see
`ERF_ApplySurfaceTreatment_BulkCoeff.cpp` / `ERF_MakeSources.cpp` on branch
`ERF`. Upstream still has the defect.

## 5. erftools

- Modern eccodes renamed accumulated flux fields
  ("Surface sensible heat flux" -> "Time-integrated surface sensible heat
  net flux"); `ReadERA5_SurfaceData`'s substring matches collect nothing and
  crash with "need at least one array to stack"
  (`erftools_eccodes_compat.py` in this directory patches it).
- ERA5 SST carries ~9999 K fill values over land; erftools writes them into
  the surface binaries unmasked, and bilinear interpolation smears them into
  coastal sea cells (values of several thousand K observed). Should be
  masked/filled at write time.
- `pyproject.toml` packaging omits subpackages (a pip install succeeds but
  `erftools.preprocessing` is missing); several imports (cartopy,
  herbie-data, pygrib, tqdm, dateutil, yt) are undeclared.
- The era5 notebook requires `TypicalAtmosphereData/` but only the gfs
  notebooks ship it.

## 6. Anelastic mode is incompatible with the HindCast pathway (three independent failures)

Measured on the 2-km ChannelIslands config (this fork, branch `ERF`):

- **Adaptive dt is unbounded from the at-rest IC.** The HindCast IC starts
  the state at rest (item 1), so the anelastic dt estimator (advective CFL
  only — no acoustic constraint) returns "undefined"/unbounded; the run
  reached 12 model-hours in 4 steps, NaN'd, and aborted in the hindcast
  frame-interpolation weights (`alpha1 = -0.084`).
- **Pressure blow-up at the lateral momentum sponge.** With `fixed_dt=2.6`
  the run survives ~50 steps, then the state fed to radiation shows
  `p_lay` up to 1718 hPa and temperatures at the gas-optics table ceiling
  (355 K), localized at the north-edge sponge — the anelastic pressure
  projection and the hindcast momentum sponge are inconsistent at the
  boundary. (Compressible with the identical deck runs clean.)
- **No compressible→anelastic restart.** Anelastic restart requires
  `Level_0/PP_Inc_H`, which compressible checkpoints do not write, so the
  obvious workaround (spin up compressible, switch to anelastic) aborts at
  I/O.

Worth fixing upstream: measured anelastic per-step cost on this config is
~12% BELOW compressible (no acoustic substepping outweighs the FFT-
preconditioned GMRES Poisson solve), and the advective dt estimate is ~8x
the compressible (acoustic-bound) dt — a large win if the boundary
treatment supported it.

## 7. check_for_low_temp floods stdout with the HindCast IC

The dry-isentropic 300 K IC (item 1) puts every cell above ~11.4 km below
the 188 K microphysics validity floor, so `ERF::check_for_low_temp`
(called twice per step with any moisture model) emits ~30,000 device
printfs per step — ~12M warning lines in a 400-step run. The `Abort()` in
the device lambda does not fire in release GPU builds, so the run
continues; the flood is log bloat plus SEVERE printf overhead: fixing it
(reduction + one summary line per check, done in this fork's `ERF.cpp`)
took the full 2-km hindcast step from 0.159 to 0.0348 s/step — the
per-cell device printf was 4.6x of total runtime, and it also scales
pathologically with GPU stream count (4 streams: 0.68 s/step WITH the
flood vs 0.0287 WITHOUT). State evolution verified identical (MASS to 9
digits over 400 steps). Upstream should adopt the summary form.

## 8. HindCast lateral boundary has no inflow treatment: domain mass grows without bound

Measured at 3 km (all numbers from `run_hindcast` logs on branch `ERF`,
with the theta/qv coupling of item 1 implemented so runs survive past
spin-up): with `Outflow` (foextrap) lateral faces and the momentum sponge
forcing ERA5 winds, mass flows in through inflow faces with no
characteristic/specified treatment and never leaves. **Global mass reaches
2.35x its initial value after 9 model hours**; density in the sponge bands
grows ~0.1-0.3 kg/m3 per hour (worst at band-overlap corners) until the
surface pressure breaks the EOS/radiation (~1.9-2.4 kg/m3 at blowup).

Sensitivity (24-h attempts, 3-km config, blowup time):
- sponge strength 0.3, no diffusion: 4.6 h
- + 6th-order numerical diffusion (0.12): 5.2 h
- + max-weight (non-additive) band overlap: 5.5 h
- strength 0.05 + diffusion: 9.1 h (rate halves, does not vanish)

Approaches that made things WORSE (documented so nobody retries them):
- RHS mass-equation relaxation toward forecast rho: destabilizes the
  acoustic substepping within ~60 steps.
- Forecast-rho weighting of the theta/qv sponge targets (rho_f*theta_f):
  NaN within ~50 steps.
- Direct post-step density blending in the bands: NaN at ~800 steps
  (alpha~0.9/step) and ~420 steps (alpha~0.04/step).

**Fix needed**: a real specified/characteristic inflow boundary (WRF-style
specified zone at the face, or characteristic-based inflow BC) for the
HindCast pathway. The momentum sponge alone over-determines the velocity
while leaving the mass/pressure at the face unconstrained.

Related port defect found on the way: the MYNN-EDMF column solver clips its
internal qke at 150 m2/s2, but the clip never reaches the dycore-advected
prognostic RhoKE (in WRF the clipped qke IS the prognostic state). Measured
consequence: TKE ran past 200 m2/s2 at 8-15 km (2.5-km cells, strong jet
shear) on this config. Fixed in this fork by bounding the prognostic state
each step (`bound_mynn_tke` in ERF_Advance.cpp, `erf.bound_pbl_tke`).
